PURPOSE: This document serves as a critical reference for maintaining code consistency and following established patterns in the IndieNode project. It outlines key architectural decisions, important rules, and implementation guidelines that must be followed to ensure the application's stability and proper functionality.

THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER DO:
- Never change how image files are handled in any way, if you feel like you are accidentally changing how image files or paths are handled, stop what you are doing and chat with me please
- Never change how UI is handled in any way, if you feel like you are accidentally changing how UI is handled, stop what you are doing and chat with me please
- Never replace actually code in the codebase with placeholder text like [...rest of the file remains the same...]

IMPORTANT PROJECT NOTES:

IndieNode is a dapp for decentralized ecommerce, giving full ownership of shops to business owners.

Ensure app alligns with Twelve-Factor App methodologys:
I. Codebase
One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys
II. Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies
III. Config
Store config in the environment
IV. Backing services
Treat backing services as attached resources
V. Build, release, run
Strictly separate build and run stages
VI. Processes
Execute the app as one or more stateless processes
VII. Port binding
Export services via port binding
VIII. Concurrency
Scale out via the process model
IX. Disposability
Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown
X. Dev/prod parity
Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible
XI. Logs
Treat logs as event streams
XII. Admin processes
Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes



1. Shop Data Management:
   - Current shop being worked on is stored in both memory (Shop struct) and on disk (current_shop.json)
   - current_shop.json serves as the source of truth for the shop being edited
   - current_shop.json is cleared when generate shop button is clicked

2. File Structure:
   shops/
   ├── [shop_name]/          # Each shop has its own directory
   │   ├── assets/           # Contains all assets for this specific shop
   │   │   ├── logos/        # Shop logo storage
   │   │   └── item_images/  # Product images storage
   │   └── src/              # Shop website files
   │       ├── index.html
   │       └── style.css

3. Critical File Handling Rules:
***Do not change how image files are handled in any way, if you feel like you are accidentally changing how image files or paths are handled, stop what you are doing and chat with me please***
   - NEVER create a global 'assets' directory in the main 'shops' directory
   - When copying files (logos, images), ALWAYS:
     * Copy FROM: The local source path stored in Shop struct and current_shop.json
     * Copy TO: The appropriate subdirectory within the specific shop's directory
   - All paths in the generated HTML should be relative paths within the shop's directory

4. Authentication:
   - Uses Ethereum wallet authentication via SIWE (Sign-In with Ethereum)
   - Shop ownership is tied to Ethereum addresses
   - Thread-safe user state management using mutex
   - Streamlined authentication flow without redundant windows

5. Generated HTML:
    - Responsive grid layout for items
    - Centered content within item cards
    - Color theming using shop's chosen colors
    - Proper image paths relative to HTML location
    - Buy button linked to sellers MetaMask wallet for each item (to be added)

6. Main Window UI Organization:
***Do not change how UI is handled in any way, if you feel like you are accidentally changing how UI is handled, stop what you are doing and chat with me please***
    - Use tabs for clear separation of functionality:
      * Shop List Tab: View and manage all created shops
      * Shop Creator Tab: Full-width interface for creating/editing shops
      * Settings Tab: Application and IPFS settings
    - Each tab should utilize full window width to avoid cramped interfaces
    - Shop Creator should have:
      * Clear sections for basic info, styling, and items
      * Generous spacing between elements
      * Preview area that doesn't compress input fields
    - Avoid nested containers that make the interface feel cluttered
    - Use scrolling containers for lists rather than compressing content

7. IPFS Integration:
   - Proper version detection and display in UI
   - Supports both system-wide and custom IPFS installations
   - Version information shown in status label
   - All IPFS-related type definitions MUST be in ipfs/types.go:
     * IPFSManager struct
     * DaemonStatus and other IPFS-specific types
     * IPFS-related constants
   - Other ipfs/*.go files should only contain method implementations

Things to remember:
- When you're ready to build for production, set DEV_MODE = false


After implementing the orbitDB:
Change the site template so that the following features are implemented:
   - Add a buy button to each item, the buy button should show the price of each item in USD (which it gets from the orbitDB) and it should have the price in ethereum that it gets using a free of chain read only call
   - When the buyer clicks the buy button, connect to the buyer's MetaMask wallet (if not already connected).
   - Initiate a payment transaction to the seller's wallet for the specified price.
   - Prompt the buyer to confirm the transaction via MetaMask.
   - After transaction, prompt the buyer for an email adress that they can recieve payment updates from
   - Send email to the seller notifying them of the transaction (it should say which item and for how much).
   - Notify the buyer of the transaction status (e.g., success or failure).


Next Steps:

- check db/orbitdb for code related to orbitDB set up
- Show key information about the OrbitDB instance:
   Connection status (Connected/Disconnected)
   Database directory path
   Network mode (public/private)
   Number of shops currently in the database
   The status would update whenever the settings tab is opened, showing you the real-time state of your OrbitDB instance.

- Change shop template to use OrbitDB to load shop data (price and name of each item)
- When editing a shop, save the changes to OrbitDB and add new images to IPFS directory (Do this seperatley after previous steps)
